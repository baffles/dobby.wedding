Dina caught Bobby's eye during an intense game of ultimate frisbee in Saratoga State Park with some friends. From there they would talk every now and then, usually during church events. Fast forward a few months and they went on their "first date" to downtown Saratoga. A week later Bobby came to Dina's for a casual dinner with her and her sister on a Friday night. After he left, while she was debriefing the evening with her sister, there was a knock on the door. Dina answers the door to Bobby standing there, saying "I think I forgot something." And then goes in for a kiss (like a scene from a movie)! Even after that it still took him months to convince her he was here to stay.

On February 25, 2017 she asked him to be her boyfriend. He said yes! Since then, they've had a ton of adventures, including a few road trips, visits to too many breweries to count (with a glass from each one), riding roller coasters (to Dina's protest), hiking the Adirondacks, the *Harry Potter* play on Broadway, and even unintentionally visiting several MLB fields.

Two years later, Dina's sister invited them to a "double date" in Lake Placid to go on a horse-drawn sleigh ride. While walking around downtown, they wandered over to Mirror Lake. Dina accidentally set up the perfect proposal spot while framing a picture for her sister and soon-to-be brother in law. Little did she know what would happen a few minutes later. When it was their turn to have their picture taken, Bobby proposed! She said yes (duh)!

They're so excited to now get to spend the rest of their lives together, talking in their own made up language that usually makes no sense to anyone else around them, adventuring around the world (racking up more breweries along the way), playing board games, brewing beer, seeing how many foods they can make from scratch (they have ice cream and cheese so far), and continued protests from Dina about riding roller coasters.
